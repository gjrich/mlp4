# Classification Project

## Section 1. Import and Inspect the Data
### 1.1 Load the dataset and display the first 10 rows.
### 1.2 Check for missing values and display summary statistics.

## Section 2. Data Exploration and Preparation
### 2.1 Explore data patterns and distributions
### 2.2 Handle missing values and clean data
### 2.3 Feature selection and engineering

## Section 3. Feature Selection and Justification
### 3.1 Choose features and target
### 3.2 Define X and y

## Section 4. Train a Model (Classification: Choose 1: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
### 4.1 Split the data into training and test sets using train_test_split (or StratifiedShuffleSplit if class imbalance is an issue).
### 4.2 Train model using Scikit-Learn model.fit() method.
### 4.3 Evalulate performance

## Section 5. Try Alternate Model (Implement a Second Option)
### 5.1 Train an alternative classifier (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) OR adjust hyperparameters on the original model.
### 5.2 Compare performance of first model and alternate model across the same performance metrics.
